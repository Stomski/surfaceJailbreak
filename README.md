# surfaceJailbreak

came into a windows surface RT, lets see what this thing can do!

so the plan is to just kind of keep track of what ive done and used in this repo, in case i ever have to do this again for some reason

# MAIN TOPICS:

articles / files i used in the jailbreak, some notes

notes on the process of getting git repos authorized and pulling from this thing, those notes are going to be very useful

## Jailbreak Process
